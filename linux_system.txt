Hardware Layer: Includes physical components like the CPU, memory, storage devices, and input/output devices.

Kernel Layer: The core part of Linux that manages resources. It handles:

Process Management: Scheduling and executing processes.
Memory Management: Allocating and managing system memory.
Device Drivers: Interface between hardware and software.
File System: Organizing data storage.
Networking: Managing network communication.
System Libraries: Precompiled functions (e.g., glibc) used by applications to interact with the kernel.

System Utilities: Essential programs like shells (Bash), background services (daemons), and system commands (ls, ps).

User Applications: Programs run by users, like browsers, text editors, and servers, which interact with the kernel through system calls.
